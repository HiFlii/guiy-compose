An upcoming Spigot/PaperMC UI library built on the [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) compiler.

If you are new to Compose, please read the link above. In short, it is a declarative UI library that makes working with state good, gives easy access to coroutines, and helps write complex UI faster.

Stay tuned, coming soon:tm:!

## Thanks
A lot of the code to actually set up the Jetpack Compose environment comes from https://github.com/JakeWharton/mosaic.
